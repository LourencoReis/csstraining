            <li>Monster hunter Wilds - "Monster Design , Chef's kiss" Is what he had to say as his favourite game quote. The that brought us together to meet.So happy to have met you through such a good game that i love so dearly.</li>
            <li>Where Winds Meet - Even its a new game i can see ourselves playing this brand new fun game i hope to spend many hours with you in this game that we both found intresting. </li>
            <li>Honkai: Star Rail -Although a game i havent played a lot i see that you'd like the design of the characters and the story as you normally do. I'll definetly put it on my list to play  </li>
            <li>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora - A game from a universe you so much adore and love so much , a adaptaion from a movie to a game. The sole reason you upgraded your pc. Something so special to you.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; color: #667eea;">Gaming Memories</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">As something that started purely as two guys trying to make friends to play mh wilds developed into two guys completly in love with each other and with a common obsession to spend time with each other. It's magical how a game can bring two souls together to be so close to each other.</p>
