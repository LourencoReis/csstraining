        <h2>About Sef</h2>
        <p>This page is all about you dear , this part of the website is all dedicated to how i percieve you </p>
        <p>From the moment we met i could tell that you were a kind soul , a sweet boy who always likes to have a laugh , someone sweet. After what already like 2 months? we started talking in october and now in the end of november we're meeting , funny how life is. </p>
        <p>Anyways , Sef is a person that is very shy , likes to keep a lot of things to himself , he always has a lot to say although he often feels like he's too much or annoying or attention seeking. This is completly not true but a defense mechanism to prevent something bad from happening or that could happen. Even with this i believe that sef tells me a lot and i am proud of him for letting go somewhat of his filter and telling me what's going on with him.</p>
        <p>Sef adores reading , cant go long without doing it and i cant blame him , it brings him so much peace when he's reading. I just feel bad when we're calling and he's reading that i talk too much. Besides that he adores his dogs , Erik and Roma! Which is something i also relate to my own dogs.</p>
        <p>Overall Seffie is a very sweet soul , curious , smart , but closed to himself</p>
