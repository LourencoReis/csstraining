        <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; color: #667eea;">Why does sef like them so much?</h3>
        <ul style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 2;">
            <li>In the start of 2024 there was a "mary on a cross" trend and then sef found a tiktok about it (although i dont understand) sef decided to look more into the band itself because sef likes the song named "Mary on a Cross" and sef really enjoyed their theme , music and overall chemistry. He just became obsessed with it and really fell in love with their music</li>
